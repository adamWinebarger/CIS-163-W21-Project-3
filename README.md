# CIS-163-W21-Project-3
Basically, for my last project in CS2 for the winter 21 semester, I started dabbling more heavily in Kotlin when programming in java. I ended up building 2 projects - 1 as a Java/kotlin hybrid and one entirely in kotlin. I figured these'd be good for anyone who's thinking about getting into kotlin on their own time. Also, they're fun to look at and I like them
